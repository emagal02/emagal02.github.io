1) My personally coded website consists of multiple implementations of both CSS and HTML code:
	- divs: I used divs to modify text according to header and text weight. 
	- classes: I successfully used classes to modify pictures aesthetically on the webpage. 
	- links: I used links in order to navigate to and from different pages, as well as import fonts from google fonts.
	- unordered lists: I listed many of my skills and activities with unordered lists. 
2) Ryan Osgood, Anna Str√∏e, and Emily Lin.
3) I spent a great deal of time on this project, probably 6 hours.
